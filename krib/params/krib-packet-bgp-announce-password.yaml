Description: "Packet.net BGP Announce password for sidecar"
Documentation: |
  Sets the BGP MD5_PASSWORD used for the packet.net BGP announce
  sidecar.  This must match the Packet side password as set up
  when BGP Peering was enabled on the Packet Project.  If the
  password is not correct, the Virtual IP will NOT be announced
  in to the local BGP fabric.

  This password is not available in the metadata service, but is
  available via the Packet User Portal, or via API call. If this
  password is not set, then DRP will attempt to make an API call
  to obtain the password for the Project.
